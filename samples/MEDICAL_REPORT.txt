Physician: Dr. Sarah Mitchell, MD

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, persistent headaches, and fatigue for 3 weeks

History of Present Illness:
Patient reports experiencing moderate shortness of breath upon minimal exertion, frequent headaches in the morning, and general fatigue throughout the day. Symptoms began 3 weeks ago after a stressful period at work.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension (diagnosed 5 years ago)
- Type 2 Diabetes (diagnosed 8 years ago)
- Hyperlipidemia (diagnosed 3 years ago)

Medications:
- Lisinopril 10mg daily (for hypertension)
- Metformin 1000mg twice daily (for diabetes)
- Atorvastatin 20mg daily (for cholesterol)

Physical Examination:
- Height: 5'10"
- Weight: 195 lbs
- BMI: 28.0 (overweight)
- Blood Pressure: 155/98 mmHg (elevated)
- Heart Rate: 92 bpm (slightly elevated)
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/min (normal range)
- Temperature: 98.6°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

Laboratory Results:
- Hemoglobin A1c: 8.2% (above target, indicating suboptimal diabetes control)
- Fasting Glucose: 185 mg/dL (elevated)
- Total Cholesterol: 215 mg/dL (borderline high)
- LDL Cholesterol: 145 mg/dL (elevated)
- HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (low)
- Triglycerides: 210 mg/dL (elevated)
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (normal)
- BNP: 250 pg/mL (elevated - suggests possible heart strain)

Imaging Studies:
- Chest X-ray: Mild cardiomegaly noted; no acute pulmonary pathology
- EKG: Sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy pattern
- Echocardiogram: Ejection fraction 50% (borderline low); mild left atrial enlargement

Assessment:
1. Uncontrolled hypertension
2. Poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
3. Dyslipidemia
4. Possible early heart failure (LVEF borderline, elevated BNP)
5. Left ventricular hypertrophy
6. Obesity (BMI 28.0)

Critical Health Risks Identified:
- Increased risk for myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Progressive heart failure
- Diabetic complications (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy)
- Stroke risk due to uncontrolled hypertension

Clinical Recommendations:
1. Increase Lisinopril to 20mg daily to better control blood pressure
2. Add Amlodipine 5mg daily for additional BP control
3. Adjust Metformin to 1500mg twice daily; consider adding GLP-1 agonist
4. Increase Atorvastatin to 40mg daily
5. Add Aspirin 81mg daily for cardiovascular protection
6. Lifestyle modifications:
   - Weight reduction goal: 170 lbs (10% reduction)
   - Low-sodium diet (target <2000mg/day)
   - Increase physical activity to 150 minutes/week moderate aerobic exercise
   - Smoking cessation (if applicable)
   - Stress management and sleep optimization
7. Follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to reassess blood pressure and diabetes control
8. Cardiology referral for further evaluation of possible heart failure
