# BrainDoc AI — Document Intelligence

Tagline: Unlock Insights from Every Document.

BrainDoc AI is a Streamlit RAG app. Upload PDFs/DOCX/TXT, pick a domain (Healthcare, Legal, Finance, Education), and get contextual answers with source citations. Safety checks block risky queries; chat history is saved between turns.

## 🧭 How It Works
1) Upload & parse: User uploads PDF/DOCX/TXT; `file_loader` saves temp files, reads, and chunks text (700 size, 100 overlap) with PDF fallbacks (PyPDF → PDFPlumber → PyMuPDF).
2) Embed & index: `embedder` builds a FAISS vector store from chunks using OpenAI embeddings.
3) Domain-aware prompting: `domain_prompts` picks the prompt for Healthcare/Legal/Finance/Education.
4) Retrieval-augmented Q&A: `qa_chain` retrieves relevant chunks and queries the LLM with domain prompt + question.
5) Safety checks: `app.py` blocks very long or suspect questions before sending to the model.
6) Memory: `memory_manager` trims/saves chat history so answers stay concise across turns.
7) UI loop: Streamlit renders results, shows session metrics in the sidebar, and chat history in the main panel.
8) Sources: After answers, a “Sources Used” section previews the top context chunks.

High-level flow:

User → Upload files → Parse & chunk → Embed → FAISS search → Domain prompt + question → LLM answers → Store chat history

## 🧪 Quick Test with Sample Documents
Upload any file from the `samples/` folder to test each domain:

| Domain | Document | Try Asking |
|--------|----------|------------|
| 🏥 Healthcare | `MEDICAL_REPORT.txt` | "What are the critical health risks identified?" |
| ⚖️ Legal | `SOFTWARE_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.txt` | "What are the restrictions on the licensee?" |
| 💼 Finance | `FINANCIAL_REPORT.txt` | "What were the major revenue sources?" |
| 🎓 Education | `COURSE_SYLLABUS.txt` | "What are the course objectives?" |
